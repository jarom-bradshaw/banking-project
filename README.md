# Overview

This project is a simple banking system application developed to demonstrate the use of the C# programming language. The application allows users to create and manage different types of bank accounts, perform transactions such as deposits, withdrawals, and transfers, and generate reports for accounts and users.

The purpose of writing this software is to gain a deeper understanding of object-oriented programming concepts in C#, such as inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation, as well as to practice working with file I/O and exception handling.
